# Flood Prediction in the United States using machine learning methods

## Introduction

  Floods can be categorized into both slow- developing flowing water and flash flowing water. Floods are temporary but have an exceptional  impact on the area while flooding. We built a Random Forest prediction model based on and visualize the probability of flooding among different areas in Tableau. We also built a small email service to alert counties about the possibility of future flooding. We hope that our application can help with future flood detection and prevent within the United States.
  
  We collected the datasets from three different sources provided by the United States National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Then, we analyzed and extracted important features such as the amount of precipitation and wind in certain areas out of the datasets. We built the random forest prediction model using MLlib in Apache Spark to predict the outcomes of future floods. We then built a Tableau workbook to visualize the results of flood prediction and a small application for emailing county officials about upcoming floods in their area.
